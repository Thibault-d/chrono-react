This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## My React Chronometer

Current functions:
* Start (with prevention of starting again if already running and start from the value when paused)
* Pause
* Reset

Functions to add:
* Handle milliseconds, minutes, hours
* Better design, using Bulma
* Refactorize, I'm sure it can be done in 50% of the code I did
